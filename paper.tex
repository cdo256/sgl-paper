\section{Introduction}
Programs such as proof assistants, SMT solvers and compilers that operate on
complex data-structures all require a representation of bound-variables. Many
attempts have been made to formalize the semantics of variable binding,
including category-theoretic models, Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS),
Nominal Techniques, De Bruijn Indices, first-order/nameful paradigms, and
graphical representations.

\subsection{Desiderata}
%TODO: Trim these down to 4 or 5.
Let's start by defining 'nice' properties that we want the model to have.

We want the following features:

%\begin{theorem}
%thm
%\end{theorem}

%\begin{desideratum}[Natural self-descriptivity]
%\label{self-descriptivity}
%There are no special meta-constructs that can't be easily represented in the
%object langage.
%\end{desideratum}
%
%\begin{desideratum}[Capture-avoiding substitution]
%\label{capture-avoiding}
%\end{desideratum}
%
%\begin{desideratum}[Symmetry-preserving]
%\label{symmetry-preserving}
%\end{desideratum}
%
%%TODO: Express this better
%\begin{desideratum}[Can encode high-level concepts]
%\label{high-level}
%\end{desideratum}
%
%\begin{desideratum}[Semantic-complete]
%\label{semantic-completeness}
%\end{desideratum}
%
%\subsection{Other Approaches}
%In representing abstract syntax with variable binding, several models and
%schools of thought have been developed. This section reviews some of the
%principal approaches in the literature.
%
%\subsubsection{Syntax Graph Models}
%Syntax graph models represent syntax structures as graphs, where nodes
%correspond to operations or constructs and edges denote the relationships or
%bindings between them. These models are particularly effective for visualizing
%intricate dependencies and relationships in syntax.
%
%\subsubsection{Category Theoretic Models}
%Category theory offers a rigorous mathematical framework for modeling syntax
%with variable binding. In this approach, categories of models correspond to
%binding signatures, with each model comprising variable sets endowed with
%algebraic and substitution structures. This method enables an abstract,
%compositional treatment of syntax, supporting initial algebra semantics and
facilitating semantic substitution lemmas \cite{fiore99cat}.
%
%\subsubsection{Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS)}
%Higher-Order Abstract Syntax (HOAS) employs the binding mechanisms of the typed
%lambda calculus to represent various forms of binding. This technique shifts the
%complexity of variable binding to the meta-level, thereby ensuring uniform
%handling of properties like renaming and substitution. Nevertheless, it
%introduces challenges for structural recursion and induction \cite{gabbay02hoas}.
%
%\subsubsection{Nominal Techniques}
%Nominal techniques explicitly use names to handle variable binding, often
%leveraging permutation models or nominal sets. This approach aids in reasoning
%about alpha-equivalence and fresh name generation, making it especially suitable
%for formal systems involving variable-binding operations \cite{pitts16nominal}.
%
%\subsubsection{De Bruijn Indices}
%De Bruijn indices provide a nameless representation of variables, using numeric
%indices to signify variable scopes. This technique simplifies alpha-equivalence
%handling, though it can make the syntax less intuitive to human readers
%\cite{bruijn72lambda}.
%
%Each of these approaches presents distinct advantages and limitations. The
%choice of model often depends on specific application requirements, including
%ease of reasoning, computational efficiency, and human readability.

%\subsection{Some new notation}
%
%Semantic graphs are graphs like the below:
%
%\begin{tikzpicture}
%\node {+}
%    child {node {3} edge from parent[-0]}
%    child {node {2} edge from parent[-1]}
%    ;
%\end{tikzpicture}
